## Lab 6 - Developing an end to end Application with AWS

### Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to use the AWS SDK and several AWS services to build an end to end serverless web application instead of the little pieces you have been building in the previous labs.

The idea of this web application is to provide a way for users to create and manage text notes and play them back audibly in different accents and voices by using Amazon Polly.

The web app will have the following:

- A frontend based on Angular whose files will be hosted on a static website in Amazon S3.
- A backend based on Amazon Cognito User Pools, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Polly.

There is a need to develop one Lambda function as part of this lab and use four Lambda functions that have already been coded for you. Once you complete the lab and you still have time remaining, take the challenge by coding three of those four Lambda functions yourself.

This lab makes use of the following AWS services:

#### Amazon API Gateway

- Create, maintain, and secure APIs at any scale. Run multiple versions of the same API simultaneously with quick iteration, testing, and release. Throttle traffic and authorize API calls to withstand traffic spikes. Monitor performance metrics and information on API calls, data latency, and error rates.
- [Learn more about Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway)

#### Amazon Cognito

- Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
- [Learn more about Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito)

#### Amazon DynamoDB

- Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications.
- [Learn more about Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb)

#### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

- Amazon EC2 is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It reduces the time required to obtain and boot a new server instance to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up-and-down, as your computing requirements change.
- [Learn more about Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2)

#### Amazon Lambda

- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.
- [Learn more about AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

#### Amazon Polly

- Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike speech, allowing you to create applications that talk, and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. Polly's Text-to-Speech (TTS) service uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize natural sounding human speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages, you can build speech-enabled applications that work in many different countries.
- [Learn more about Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly)

#### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.
- [Learn more about IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam)

#### Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

### Start Lab

#### Task 1: Connect to your development environment

This lab is to be completed using the Windows Dev Instance for the .NET and the Java versions of the lab.

The Python version of the lab will be completed using the Linux Dev Instance. You will be instructed to use EC2 Instance Connect at the appropriate times.

For now, connect to the Windows Dev Instance using one of the following options if you are going to use the .NET or Java version of the lab. Otherwise move ahead to Task 1.2:

- [Connect to Your Windows Dev Instance from a Windows Machine using RDP]()
- [Connect to Your Windows Dev Instance from a macOS Machine using RDP]()

##### Task 1.2: Command window options

When lab instructions in subsequent sections require a command window, use a PowerShell session.

#### Task 2: Choose a programming language

4. Choose the programming language you would like to use for this lab. You can use the .NET, Java, or Python.

#### Task 3: (Java) - Amazon Cognito Authentication

The AWS SDK for Java simpliÔ¨Åes use of AWS Services by providing a set of libraries that are consistent and familiar for Java developers.

- [Learn more about the AWS SDK for Java](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java)

In this task, you will:

- Create an Amazon Cognito user pool, which you are going to use to authenticate your end users and control access through API Gateway, making sure that your endpoint is secure.
- Create and confirm an Amazon Cognito user using the Linux Dev Instance. The Amazon Cognito user is used to test the end to end application.

![lab-6-diagram1-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131244291-8bce3292-9d91-44a2-aa7d-ba879d4a8a86.png)

For more information on Amazon Cognito User Pools, see: Amazon Cognito User Pools: [Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html)

##### Task 3.1: (Java) - Creating an Amazon Cognito user pool

247. From the browser tab logged into the Amazon Management Console, choose Services and select Cognito.

Verify that you are in the correct region. If you are unsure of the region, you can see it identified in the Lab Information section to the left of these instructions. Every service that is used in the lab (Amazon Cognito, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB) must be in the same region. Take a note of this region and every time the instructions prompt you to verify your region, make sure it is the same.

248. Choose Manage User Pools
249. Choose Create a user pool
250. For **Pool name**, enter: 
251. For **How do you want to create your user pool?**, choose **Step through settings**
252. Go to the **Which standard attributes do you want to require?** section.

This step can't be modified once the User Pool is created. To correct this, you would need to delete the current User Pool and create a new one.

253. Remove the checkbox next to **email** and choose Next step
254. In the **What password strength do you want to require?** section, you set the specifics required for the password. The password used is for testing purposes and you will be entering it many times so it has limited security settings.

Make the following configuration:

- **Minimum length**

Unselect the following options:

- Require numbers
- Require special character
- Require uppercase letters
- Require lowercase letters 

255. Choose Next step
In the navigation menu on the left, you will find a list of all of the main steps for the creation of the Amazon Cognito User Pool. As many settings can stay as the defaults, you will skip ahead and go to the ones that need to be modified.

256. Choose **App clients**.
257. Choose **Add an app client**
Make sure that you follow the next steps exactly as this configuration can't be undone. To correct, you would have to delete the current App client and create a new one.

- **App client name:**
- Unselect **Generate client secret.**

258. Choose Create app client
259. In the navigation menu on the left, choose **Review** and review all of the settings.
260. Choose Create pool
261. Save the **Pool Id** and the **Pool ARN** from your Amazon Cognito Pool information into a separate file for use later in this lab.

Make sure to note that it is for **Amazon Cognito Pool Id** and **Amazon Cognito Pool ARN** as well.

For example, in the Oregon region, the **Pool Id** would look like **us-west-2_XXXXXXXXX** and the **Pool ARN** would look like **arn:aws:cognito-idp:us-west-2:012345678901:userpool/us-west-2_XXXXXXXXX.

262. In the navigation pane on the left, under **General settings**, choose **App clients**.
263. Save the **App client id** in the form of xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx information into the same file. Make sure to note that it is for the **Amazon Cognito App client id**.

##### Task 3.2: (Java) - Creating a user for the Amazon Cognito user pool

In this task, you will create and confirm an Amazon Cognito user by using the Linux Dev Instance. The Amazon Cognito user is used to test the end to end application.

You could connect to your Windows Dev Instance and open a PowerShell session to complete this step. However, to show another option, you will connect to the Linux Dev Instance using EC2 Instance Connect. It will connect you to a web-based ssh session.

264. From the browser tab logged into the **Amazon Management Console**, choose Services and select **EC2**.
265. Choose **Instances**.
266. Select **Linux Instance Dev** and then choose Connect
267. Select the **EC2 Instance Connect** tab.
268. Ensure the **User name field** is set to .
269. Choose **Connect**
270. Enter the following command, but make sure to change **change-me_app-client-id** with the value of the **App client id** that you copied to a file earlier:

``` markdown
aws cognito-idp sign-up --client-id change-me_app-client-id --username student --password student

**Expected output:**

{
    "UserConfirmed": false,
    "UserSub": "abc70c2f-52v7-4abc-c195-012abc8560ab"
}
```
The values in the output should show your specific configuration.

You have now created a user in Amazon Cognito with the username and a password of . Even though this isn't secure, you are using a simple username and password for simplicity during testing.

271. Next, confirm the user that you created. You will need to change **change-me_pool-id** with the value of the **Pool Id** that you copied to a file earlier.

To confirm the user, enter the following command:

`
aws cognito-idp admin-confirm-sign-up --user-pool-id change-me_pool-id --username student
`
If you don't see any output, it means that the command is successful and you can continue.

If the EC2 Instance Connect SSH session stops responding, hit the browser refresh button to re-initialize it.

272. Go back to the **Amazon Cognito** console, choose Manage User Pools
273. Under User Pools choose **PollyNotesPool**.
274. Under **General settings**, choose **Users and groups**.

You should see the username student and the status is **CONFIRMED**. If you do not see it, choose to refresh the browser.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an Amazon Cognito User Pool, manually added a user, and confirmed that user.

Normally, the sign-up process would be done via the application. However, the application that you are using doesn't provide such a function. So instead, it is manually created.

#### Task 4: (Java) - Creating a DynamoDB table

In this task, you will create a table in DynamoDB called pollynotes. This table is going to be used to store your user id, along with your notes.

![lab-6-diagram2-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131245070-38e453d2-8718-4bc3-9dd0-10557a3e3223.png)

275. From the browser tab logged into the **Amazon Management Console**, choose Services and select **DynamoDB**.
276. Choose the **Tables** link on the navigation menu on the left side.
277. Choose **Create table**
278. For **Table name**, enter:
279. For **Primary key**, enter: (String)
280. Select **Add sort key**.
281. For **Add sort key**, enter: (String)
282. Choose **Create**
283. You should be placed on the pollynotes table pane. If not, choose the **pollynotes** table.
284. Choose the **Items** tab.
285. Choose **Create item**
286. In the **VALUE** field next to **userId**, enter:
287. In the **VALUE** field next to **noteId**, enter:
288. Choose the (plus circle icon) to the left of **noteId**.
289. Select **Append** , and then choose **String**.
290. In the **FIELD**, field enter:
291. In the **VALUE** field next to **note**, enter: 
292. Choose Save
293.  Create a few more items by going through the Create item process again. For example, your next noteId should be , then , and more. The userId should always be . The note can be anything that you would like, but be aware that it will be recited back by Amazon Polly at some point.

#### Task 5: (Java) - Creating Amazon S3 buckets

In this task, you will create three Amazon S3 buckets:

- A website bucket which will host your front end website.
- An MP3 bucket which will store your MP3 files.
- A code bucket used to store your Lambda functions as they are uploaded from the AWS ToolKit in Eclipse.

You will only be creating the Amazon S3 buckets in this section and configuring them in a later step.

![lab-6-diagram3-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131250867-061aa2f6-6bc9-4992-886f-5d0d3711f02c.png)

The diagram does not show the Code bucket since it is used to store your Lambda functions only.

294. From the browser tab logged into the **Amazon Management Console**, choose Services and select **Amazon S3**.

You can see that the region is Global. This is because Amazon S3 does not require region selection. However, Amazon S3 creates buckets in a region you specify. When creating your buckets, select the correct region based on what you noted before. If you are unsure of the region, verify the value with your instructor.

##### Task 5.1: (Java) - Create the Web bucket

295. Choose Create bucket
296. **Bucket name:** enter (all lowercase):
For example, if your name is John Smith, your bucket name would be polly-notes-web-john-smith.
297. Make sure that the Region field is set to the appropriate region that you have noted earlier.
298. Choose Create bucket

##### Task 5.2: (Java) - Create the MP3 bucket

In this task you will create another Amazon S3 bucket to hold the Amazon Polly audio files.

299. Choose Create bucket
300. **Bucket name:** (all lowercase):
For example, if your name is John Smith, your bucket name would be polly-notes-mp3-john-smith.
301. Make sure that the Region field is set to the appropriate region that you have noted earlier.
302. Choose Create bucket

##### Task 5.3: (Java) - Create the Code bucket

In this task you will create another Amazon S3 bucket to hold the java code.

303. Choose Create bucket
304. **Bucket name:** (all lowercase):
For example, if your name is John Smith, your bucket name would be **polly-notes-code-john-smith**.
305. Make sure the **Region** field is set to the appropriate region that you have noted earlier.
306. Choose Create bucket

### Task 6: Reviewing an IAM managed policy and creating an IAM role

In this task, you will review an IAM Managed Policy and create an IAM Role to allow your Lambda functions to:

- Perform CRUD operations on DynamoDB.
- Call the Amazon Polly API.
- Perform the PUT operation on Amazon S3 for the MP3.
- Log events to CloudWatch.

![lab-6-diagram3b-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131251277-ea1b9025-cbf2-4967-9cb9-732a62f5a8e0.png)

307. From the browser tab logged into the **Amazon Management Console**, choose Services and select **IAM**.

You can see that the region is Global. IAM does not require region selection because it's a global service.

##### Task 6.1: (Java) - Review an IAM managed policy

308. To save time the **lambda_ddb_s3_polly** managed policy has already been created.
309.  The policy includes the following permissions:

``` 
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
        "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
        "polly:SynthesizeSpeech",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
    ],
                "Resource": ["*"]
            }
        ]
    }
```

#### Task 6.2: (Java) - Creating an IAM role
In this task, you will create an IAM Role called PollyNotesRole and attach the lambda_ddb_s3_polly policy to it. This Role will be used by the Lambda functions in the next sections. This IAM role allows you to delegate access with defined permissions in the above policy to trusted entities without having to hard code your credentials in your code.

310. In the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and then choose Create role
311. Under **Select type of trusted entity**, choose **AWS service**.
312. Go to the **Choose a use case** section. Choose **Lambda**, and then, choose Next: Permissions
313. In the **Search** field, enter:
314. Select the **lambda_ddb_s3_polly** policy.
315. Choose Next: Tags
316. Choose Next: Review
317. For **Role name**, enter:
318. Choose Create role

You should see a message reading:

The role **PollyNotesRole** has been created

### Task 7: (Java) - Creating the Lambda ListFunction

In this task, you will create your Lambda List function. To do this, you edit the *ListFunction.java* file.

![lab-6-diagram4-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131251622-6ec8c899-b773-4410-a693-d6e1110df2db.png)

#### Task 7.1: (Java) - Getting to the ListFunction code

319. Return to the **Windows Dev Instance**.

To test, complete the following steps:
- Open the file *ListFunctionTest.java* located in the package.
- Inspect the code of the test, which will make you realize that you are making a call to the CreateUpdateFunctionSolution function. Since this is a ListFunction, you need to make sure that there is data in the DynamoDB table. First thing to do is to create an item. Then, run your freshly coded ListFunction and make sure that the that is returned isn't empty.
- Run the test.
- You should see the output of the CreateUpdateFunctionSolution and then the beginning of your function in the Console View. If the Test successfully completes, the JUnit view should be all green. You can continue troubleshooting by using breakpoints and running the prior step again.

```
Initiating PollyNotes-CreateUpdateFunction...
Note received: {userId: "testuser", noteId: "001", note: "This is a test"}
Returning noteId: "001"
Initiating PollyNotes-ListFunction...
```
Task 7.3: (Java) - Upload Your ListFunction to Lambda

In this task, you upload your Lambda function to Lambda. To do so, you will use the AWS ToolKit that has been installed in Eclipse. This simplifies the process instead of having to use the command line. What is done in the background is for you is to create a ZIP of your code, uploading it to your code Amazon S3 bucket, creating the Lambda function by using the ZIP, and associating the IAM Role you created earlier.

331. In the Project Explorer, open the context menu for the folder and select Amazon Web Services >> Upload function to AWS Lambda...
332. For Select the Handler, complete one of the following:
- If you have coded your function, select .
- If you want to use the Solution Code, select .

333. For Select the AWS Region, select the region for your lab as you noted it before.
334. Select **Create a new Lambda function** and replace the value of the field next to it (containing MyFunction) with .
335. Choose **Next**
336. For **IAM Role**, select .
337. For **S3 Bucket**, select your code Amazon S3 Bucket: 
338. In the **Memory (MB)** field, replace the content with **1024** so that your Lambda function can start faster on the first load.
339. Choose **Finish**

You have now uploaded your Lambda function!

340. The next step is to test the Lambda function from the Lambda UI.
341. From the **AWS Console**, choose Services and select **Lambda**.

This lab uses the Updated Lambda Console. If you are unsure which version you are using, simply choose the icon in the top-left corner of the Lambda console and it will indicate if the **Update Lambda Console option** is on or off. If it shows **off**, select the toggle option to turn it on.

342. Choose **PollyNotes-ListFunction**. If you don't see your function, make sure that you are in the correct Region.
343. Choose the **Test** tab and make the following selections under Test event:
        

### Task 8: (Java) - Creating the API Gateway

In this task, you will create a Restful API to front the back-end Lambda function. The API will use Amazon Cognito identities for authentication. For the application, you will be using the AWS API Gateway Service.

![lab-6-diagram5-2020](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22528198/131251981-5c13bee7-7f47-4bb0-a852-68c79a88e95c.png)


#### Task 8.1: (Java) - Creating the Amazon Cognito Authorizer

In this task, you create the Amazon Cognito Authorizer. The Authorizer will allow you to control access to the API with the Amazon Cognito User Pool.

#### Task 8.2: (Java) - Creating the resources

In this task, you create your API Resources.

#### Task 8.3: (Java) - Creating the API GET method

### Task 9: (Java) - Creating the front-end website
