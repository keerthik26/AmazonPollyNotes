## Lab 6 - Developing an end to end Application with AWS

### Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to use the AWS SDK and several AWS services to build an end to end serverless web application instead of the little pieces you have been building in the previous labs.

The idea of this web application is to provide a way for users to create and manage text notes and play them back audibly in different accents and voices by using Amazon Polly.

The web app will have the following:

- A frontend based on Angular whose files will be hosted on a static website in Amazon S3.
- A backend based on Amazon Cognito User Pools, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Polly.

There is a need to develop one Lambda function as part of this lab and use four Lambda functions that have already been coded for you. Once you complete the lab and you still have time remaining, take the challenge by coding three of those four Lambda functions yourself.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/keerthik26/AmazonPollyNotes/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/keerthik26/AmazonPollyNotes/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
